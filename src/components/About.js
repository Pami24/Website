          <h2>About Palouse Advocates on Mental Illness</h2>
          <p>Palouse Advocates on Mental Illness is an informal support group for families of people with mental illness, as well as those carrying a diagnosis themselves. We firmly believe that treatment can help people manage their illness and lead to better function and stronger relationships. An important portion of our meetings is checking in with each other.</p>
          <p>Back in 1981, our Non-Profit Organization realized that by working together we could overcome our challenges much more efficiently, and that is why we ultimately decided to begin this support group.</p>
